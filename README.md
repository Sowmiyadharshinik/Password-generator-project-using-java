# Password-generator-project-using-java
This project aims to determine the strength of a generated password based on predefined criteria.
The goal of this project is to develop a password generator and strength checker application. The application will generate passwords and evaluate their strength using various criteria, such as length, complexity (including the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and predictability (resistance to brute-force attacks and common password guessing techniques).
Password Generation: Generate random passwords with configurable length and complexity.
Strength Evaluation: Assess the strength of generated passwords based on:
Length of the password.
Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Resistance to common password attacks.
User Interface: Provide a simple user interface to input parameters for password generation and display the strength evaluation results.
